                    </li>

                    <p class="p-2 cancel">We do not have any insurance policy covering the expenses for accident,
                        sickness, loss due to theft, or any other reasons. Visitors are advised to seek such insurance
                        arrangements in their home country. All baggages & personal property/s at all times are at the

                        <br> <br>

                        We collect a deposit payment and only then book the internal flights and other components of the
                        trip. In the exceptional event where the occupancy of the flight/ activity is higher and guest
                        needs more time to plan, we may ask for only internal flight/ activity payment first but the
                        deposit payment in this scenario is due within 1 week of booking the flight/ activity. If the
                        deposit payment is not made on time, then the company has right to cancel the flight/ activity
                        booked and use the amount as deposit payment. Also, we do not offer standalone services like
                        flight, activity bookings. Hence, if the guest makes the flight booking payment first and later
                        decides to book rest of the tour himself/ through other travel company then also the flight/
                        activity booked will be cancelled and amount considered as deposit payment. We do not offer
                        break-up of tour components. In a scenario, where the guest asks for a break-up after booking a
                        trip with us and asks for a refund for not offering break-up then company is not liable to make
                        the refund for the same.</p>
